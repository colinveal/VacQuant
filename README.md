**VacQuant**

Neurodegenerative diseases are devastating conditions characterised by progressive cognitive decline with few available treatments. 
Neurodegeneration can be quantified in vertebrate and invertebrate models of disease by analysis of vacuolation â€“ the formation of empty spaces within brain tissue. 
VacQuant, is a macro that can be loaed into ImageJ (https://imagej.net/ij/index.html) that can be paired with existing machine learning software to automatically measure the area of vacuolation in brain tissue

For more information on how to use macros in ImageJ can be found here: https://imagej.net/ij/developer/macro/macros.html
